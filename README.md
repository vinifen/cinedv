#### v-1.1

## Description:

CineDV is the homepage for a fictional cinema, created as a project to enhance web development skills. This is my first truly complete project and the first one where I used JavaScript and Bootstrap in a real implementation.

The frontend of the application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It integrates movie data from the TMDB API, while the backend is simulated using a Fake API powered by JSON Server.

### CineDV features:

- A fully responsive design.
- Automatic daily movie updates based on your computer's date.
- Interactive slides.
- Movie renderings based on a list of the top current films and upcoming releases.

## Execution
To get started, simply download the project files and open index.html using the VS Code Live Server extension.
