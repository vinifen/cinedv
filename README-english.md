## CineDV - Description 

This project aims to progressively and didactically implement a web application inspired by common operations of financial institutions (e.g., withdrawal, deposit, statement, balance, registration), with the distinguishing feature of charging excessive fees for each operation performed by the customer.

The frontend of the application was developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the backend was simulated by implementing a Fake API using JSON Server.
